# Handwritten-recognition

Summary



This notebook provides a structured approach to hand-written character recognition by leveraging multiple machine learning models. It covers the entire pipeline from data loading and preprocessing to training, evaluating, and visualizing the results. The inclusion of multiple models allows for comparison of performance, ensuring that the best possible model is identified for the task. The visualization of predictions adds a practical aspect, helping to understand how the model performs on actual hand-written characters. This comprehensive approach ensures robust model development and thorough evaluation, making it an effective solution for character recognition tasks and  very thankful for the Arnav1145 for his amazing idea which was used as resource for my current work.





1. Introduction

   
The goal of this notebook is to develop a model that can accurately recognize hand-written characters. This involves loading and preprocessing the dataset, training multiple classification models, evaluating their performance, and visualizing the predictions. The process is divided into several key sections: importing libraries, loading data, preprocessing, training models, evaluating models, and visualizing results.

3. Importing Libraries

   
The notebook begins by importing essential libraries required for data manipulation, visualization, and model building. These libraries include:

NumPy and Pandas for data handling.
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.
Keras for deep learning utilities.
A warning filter to ignore any warnings that might clutter the output.
3. Loading and Preprocessing Data
The dataset is loaded using pandas.read_csv() function. The initial few records of the dataset are displayed to understand its structure. The features (X) and the target labels (y) are separated. The labels are converted into a categorical format if necessary, which is a common preprocessing step for classification tasks.

4. Splitting Data

   
The data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split from scikit-learn. The split ensures that a portion of the data is reserved for evaluating the model's performance. Stratification is used to maintain the distribution of labels in both training and testing sets.

6. Training Multiple Models

   
Several machine learning models are trained on the dataset. Each model is fitted to the training data and then used to make predictions on the testing data. The models trained include:

Logistic Regression: A simple yet effective linear model.
Random Forest: An ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees.
Gradient Boosting: Another ensemble method that builds trees sequentially to improve performance.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A powerful model that works well with high-dimensional data.


For each model:

The training process involves fitting the model to the training data using the fit method.
Predictions on the test data are made using the predict method.
6. Model Evaluation
Each model's performance is evaluated using several metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions.
Classification Report: Detailed metrics including precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix that shows the count of true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative predictions.


For visualization:

Confusion matrices are plotted using Seaborn's heatmap function, providing a visual understanding of the model's performance across different classes.


7. Visualizing Predictions

   
The notebook includes a section for visualizing the model's predictions on a subset of test images. This involves:

Shuffling the test images to ensure a random selection.
Displaying the images in a 3x3 grid using Matplotlib subplots.
Each subplot shows a hand-written character image and the corresponding predicted label.
The predictions are displayed with a formatted title for better readability.
